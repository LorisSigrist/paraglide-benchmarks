# Paraglide Benchmarks

This repository contains benchmarks comparing paraglide to other i18n libraries. It works by generating projects using random, realworld messages from obsidian-translations and then building them with paraglide and other libraries. It outputs the results to a csv file.

The repository was built on macOS. We can't guarantee that it will work on other platforms, as it makes use of quite a few shell commands.
